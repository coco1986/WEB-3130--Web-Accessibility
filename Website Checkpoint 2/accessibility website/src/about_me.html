            <h2>When I Hear "Accessibility"</h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility is a fundamental principle that ensures equal access and usability of products, services, and information for people of all abilities. In the context of the web, accessibility is crucial to create an inclusive online environment, allowing individuals with disabilities to navigate, interact, and consume content seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that prioritizing accessibility not only aligns with ethical considerations, but also contributes to a positive user experience for everyone. In essence, a commitment to accessibility reflects a commitment to universal design principles, fostering an online space where information and services are available to everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. Embracing accessibility is not just a legal or moral obligation; it is a step toward building a more inclusive and equitable digital world.
            </p>

            <h2>Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
            <p>
                Automated tests can take longer to develop than manual tests, especially if they are not well designed. They can also be more challenging to implement into your development workflow. One of the main drawbacks of automated testing is that it initially takes a significant amount of time and money to implement. Automated tests can sometimes fail even when there is no actual issue present. For example, this can be the case if the test contains an error or is not comprehensive enough to cover all of its intended use cases.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessibility Standards I Use</h3>
            <p>
                Because I am committed to accessibility I use the following standards:
            </p>

            <ul class="standardsList">
                <li>
                   <span>HTML 5 Semantic Elements</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>CSS3</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>WAI-ARIA</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>WCAG 2.2</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Text Alternatives: </span>I provide descriptive text alternatives for non-text content such as images, graphs, and charts. This ensures that users with visual impairments can understand the content through assistive technologies like screen readers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Keyboard Accessibility: </span>I Ensure that all functionality is operable through a keyboard interface alone, without requiring specific timings for keystrokes. This helps users who may have difficulty using a mouse or other pointing device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Navigation and Focus: </span>I design navigable, consistent, and predictable websites. Provide skip navigation links, and ensure that focus is visible and can be managed by users who navigate with a keyboard or other assistive technologies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Distinguishable: </span>I ensure that content, text, and images of text have sufficient contrast, making them easily readable. This is essential for users with low vision or color blindness.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Inclusion During Design Matters</h3>
            <p class="inclusion">
                Including all people in testing and web design processes is crucial for achieving and maintaining web accessibility goals for several reasons:
            </p>

            <ul class="incList">
                <li>
                    <span>Diverse Perspectives: </span>People have diverse abilities, experiences, and needs. Involving individuals with different abilities, including those with disabilities, provides valuable insights into how various users interact with and perceive digital content. This diversity helps identify a broader range of accessibility issues and ensures that solutions cater to a wide audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>User-Centered Design: </span>People have diverse abilities, experiences, and needs. Involving individuals with different abilities, including those with disabilities, provides valuable insights into how various users interact with and perceive digital content. This diversity helps identify a broader range of accessibility issues and ensures that solutions cater to a wide audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Identifying Unintended Barriers: </span>People who are not directly involved in the development process might encounter barriers that developers overlook. Inclusive testing helps uncover unintended obstacles or usability issues that might not be apparent to the design team, fostering a more thorough and effective testing process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Testing with Assistive Technologies: </span>Individuals with disabilities often use assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, or voice input devices. Including users of these technologies in testing ensures that the website is compatible with a variety of tools and that the user experience is seamless for those relying on them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Legal and Ethical Considerations: </span>In many regions, there are legal requirements and standards (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in the United States) that mandate accessibility for digital services. Inclusive testing helps organizations comply with these legal obligations, preventing potential legal issues and promoting ethical design practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>User Satisfaction and Engagement: </span>By including a diverse range of users, designers can create websites that are more user-friendly and enjoyable for everyone. Considering the needs of all users contributes to a positive user experience, resulting in increased satisfaction and engagement with the website.

        <p>
            Cory Coleman's Accessible Website serves to demonstrate how individuals can create WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliant websites.

        <p>
            Cory Coleman is commited to ensuring accessibility through these measures:
        </p>

        <ul class="measureList">
            <li>
                Inclusion of accessibility in the mission statement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assign clear accessibility goals and responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="confHeader">Conformance Status</h3>
        <p>
            The website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
