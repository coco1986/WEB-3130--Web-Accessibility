        We are dedicated to creating a digitally accessible experience for everyone, including people living with disabilities. The work we do to provide the best user experience for everyone is ongoing, through applying the current accessibility standards as they apply to our website.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and
        developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of
        conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Cory's Accessible Website is partially
        conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the
        content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

          <p class="indent">
            The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of all Americans have a non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly 38,903,887 adults with a disability in the United States, 19.7% of them live below the poverty line. This is almost double the number of adults in the United States who are below the poverty line. This is partially due to lower rates of employment for disabled people. In the United States, 25.9% of disabled people over the age of 16 are employed in the civilian sector, while 59.6% of all US citizens over 16 are employed in the same sector.
          </p>

          <p class="indent">
            Comparing the breakdown of disability between my current state of residence, Utah, and the United States, Utah has a disabled population of 342,378 or 10.3% of the total population, compared to the United States which has 42,485,034 disabled people or 13.0% of the total population. Table 1: Disability Type by Gender for Utah and the United States shows the disparities between genders and types of disabilities.
          </p>

          <p class="no-indent">
            There are a few reasons why these disparities exist; however, that is not a topic for this page.
          </p>

          <p class="indent">
            When it comes to representation by race, there are some interesting differences between Utah and the United States. Table 2: Disability Percent by Race, you can see that Utah has a higher occurrence of disabilities in the Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Natives, Native Hawai’ian and Other Pacific Islanders, and the Hispanic or Latino communities than the United States as a whole. However, for the White community in Utah, they have a lower occurrence of disability than the national rate.
          </p>

          <p class="indent">
            When we take into consideration the rates of disabilities in the United States (roughly 40 million people) and Utah (roughly 350,000 people), we can understand the importance of building accessible experiences for all people.
